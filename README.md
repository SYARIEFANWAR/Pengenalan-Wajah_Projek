# Pengenalan-Wajah_Projek
This project detects faces in images using Haar Cascade Classifier and OpenCV. It draws bounding boxes around detected faces and saves the results. Optional DNN models can improve accuracy. Run the notebook on Google Colab or Jupyter by following the simple steps in the code.
